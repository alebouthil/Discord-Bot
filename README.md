# Discord-Bot
Dependancies:
discord.py
yt-dlp
pafy
dotenv

install youtube-dl and drag all files/folders from yt-dlp into youtube-dl folder, this tricks pafy into using yt-dlp instead, needed 
for age restricted videos

create a .env file in the same folder as the bot, adding your DISCORD_TOKEN and google DEVELOPER_KEY values to it
